# Branding Rules
* The logo can only be used by apps that run on Ethereum Classic and connect back to the offical Commonwealth contract [located here (0xDe6F...)](https://blockscout.com/etc/mainnet/address/0xde6fb6a5adbe6415cdaf143f8d90eb01883e42ac/contracts) 
* All memes are permitted. Usage of the logos are permitted as long as it is attributed, and the license is not changed.
* These logos **cannot** be used to submit to mobile app stores (App Store, Android Play Store, etc.). Please ask for guidance if you intend to use the files in this repo as part of an app logo!
